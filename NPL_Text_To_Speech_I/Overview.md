**EXPLORATION ACTIVITY 1**

**Overview**

The selected library for the sample program is spaCy, which is a popular and powerful Python library for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It is widely used for tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and more. In the program, spaCy is used to demonstrate these basic NLP tasks on user-providede text.

Creation: 
SpaCy was developed by privetly held artificial intelligence reasearch firm Explosion AI. SpaCy's development started in 2014, and since then, ther have been frequent updates and active development of the library. Due to its speed, effectiveness, and usability, it has grown to be one of the most well-known and often used natiral processing libraries inthe Python ecosystem.

What is spaCy?
SpaCy is a free, open-source library for advanced natural language processing (NLP) in Python. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and easdy to use. Spacy is used for a wide range of NLP tasks, such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, syntatic parsing, and more. It provides pre-trained models for various languages, aloowing users to perform NLP tasks without building models from scratch. SpaCy is widely used in industry and research for tasks like information extraction, text classification, and text analysis.

How to Use spaCy:
1) installation:
   We can install spaCy using 'pip'
    --> python -m pip install spaCy

2) Loading Language Models:
   While using spaCy, we need to load a language model. For example, to load the English language model:
    >> import  spacy
       nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm") 

3) Tokenization: 
   spaCy makeds it easy to tokenize text into individual words or tokens.
    >> doc = nlp("This is a sample sentence.")
       for token in doc:
           print(token.text)

4) Part-of-Speech Tagging:
   spaCy can assign part-of-Speech tags to tokens. Access the part-of-speech tag of a token with 'token.pos_':
    >> for token in doc:
           print(f"{token.text}: {token.pos_}")

5) Named Entity Recognition (NER):
   spaCy can identify named entities in text. Access named entities using 'doc.ents':
    >> for ent in doc.ent:
           print(f"{ent.text}: {ent.label_}")

6) Dependency Parsing:
   sopaCy can generate dependency parse trees to show grammatical structure of a sentence.
    >> for tokens in doc:
           print(f"{token.text}: {token.dep_} -> {token.head.text}") 

Statistical models:
While some spaCy's features operate on their own, others call for the loading of training pipelines, allowing spaCy to forecast linguistic annotations, such as whether a word is a verb or a noun. A statistical model that has been trained on labelled data can be used by numerous components of a trained pipeline. For a range of languages, spaCy now provides trained pipelines that may be installed as separate Python modules. Pipeline packages can vary in terms of their accuracy, size, speed, memory requirements, and data content. They typically include the foillowing components: 

1) Binary weights are used by the named entity recognizer, dependency parser, and part-of-speech tagger to forecast those annotations in context.
2) Words and their  context-free characterstics, such as their shape or spelling, are refered to as lexical entries in a vocabulary.
3) Lookup tables and lemmatization rules are examples of data files. 
4) word vectors, or multidimensional meaning representations oif words, are a way to compare words to another.
5) Options for configuring spaCy so that it is in the right state when the pipeline is loaded, such as language and processing pipeline settings and model implementations to utlize.

Pipelines:
When we use the npl function on text, spaCy first tokenizes it to create a Doc object. The Doc is subsequently processed in a number of phrases; this is also known as the processing pipeline. A tagger, a lemmatizer, a parser, and an entity recognizer are frequently includeed in the pipelline utlized by the trained piplrines. The processed Doc is returned by each pipeline component, which is then given to teh following component.

The components, their model, and the training  process are always what determine a processing pipeline's capabilities. A pipeline for name d entity recognition, for instance, has to have a trained named entity recogonizer component with a statistical model and weights that allow to predict entity labels. for this reason, each pipeline lists the components and the parameters for them in the configuration file:
  >>> [nlp]
      pipeline = ["tok2vec", "tagger", "parser", "ner"]

The statistical subsystems, such as the tagger and parser, are normally isolated and don't exchange any data. The named entity recognizer, for instance, doesn't employ any features set by the tagger, perser, etc. This implies that you can switch them out or eliminate particular parts of the pipeline withput having an impact on the others.

A "special" component that is not a part of the typical pipeline is the tokenizer. Additionally, it is absent from nlp.pipe_names. The reason is that there can only really be one tokenizer, and while every other pipeline element returns a Doc, the tokenizer transforms a string of text into a Doc.


SpaCy is a versatiule library that is widely used in the NLP community for various natural language processing tasks. SpaCy is known for its speed, accuaracy, and user- freindly API, making it a top choice for any NPL applications.


Functions:

1) Tokenization:
   Functionality: Split text into individual words or tokens.
   Example:
   >>>import spacy
      nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
      doc = nlp("Tokenization splits text into words.")
      for token in doc:
          print(token.text)

    Ouput: 
    Tokenization
    splits
    text
    into
    words

2) Part-of-Speech Tagging:
   Functionality: Assign grammatical categories (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each token.
   Example:
   >>>for token in doc:
          print(f"{token.text}: {token.pos_}")

    Output: 
    Tokenization: NOUN
    splits: VERB
    text: NOUN
    into: ADP
    words: NOUN

3) Named Entity Recognition (NER):
   Functionality: Identify and classify named entities in text, such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, etc.
   Example: 
   >>> doc = nlp("Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in Cupertino, California.")
       for ent in doc.ents:
           print(f"{ent.text}: {ent.label_}")

    Output:
    Apple Inc.: ORG
    Steve Jobs: PERSON
    Cupertino: GPE
    California: GPE

4) Lemmatization: 
   Functionality: Reduce words to their base or dictionary form.
   Example: 
   >>> doc = nlp("running ran runs")
       for token in doc:
            print(token.text, token.lemma_)
    
    Output:
    running run run
